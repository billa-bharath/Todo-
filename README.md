# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add tasks to a list and delete tasks once they are completed. This project is great for practicing DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## Features
- **Add tasks**: Users can add tasks to the to-do list by typing in the input field and clicking the "ADD" button.
- **Delete tasks**: Tasks can be deleted by clicking the "DELETE" button next to each task.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is designed with basic styling using CSS to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to add and remove tasks from the to-do list.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a task in the input field and click the "ADD" button to add it to your to-do list.
4. Click the "DELETE" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
5. Enjoy managing your tasks!

## Code Explanation

- **HTML**:
    - The `input` field is used for entering tasks.
    - The `button` element with the "ADD" label triggers the JavaScript function `add()` to add tasks to the list.
    - An unordered list (`ul`) with the id `listitem` is where all tasks are displayed.
  
- **CSS**:
    - Provides a simple yet attractive layout with some styling for the input, buttons, and list items.
    - Hover effects are added to the buttons for better user interaction.

- **JavaScript**:
    - The `add()` function checks if the input field is not empty, then creates a new list item (`li`) with the task and a delete button.
    - The `deleteitem()` function is triggered when the delete button is clicked, removing the task from the list.
